    "No. Pick a name and start. If the administrator turned on sign-in you can sign in, and guests can still use codesh unless guests are turned off.",
  "guide.faq.run.q": "Can I run code in codesh?",
  "guide.faq.run.a": "No. codesh shares and edits text. It doesn't run code.",
  "guide.faq.cantEdit.q": "Why can't I edit?",
  "guide.faq.cantEdit.a":
    "The owner may have set the share to view only, or locked editing for a while. Ask the owner for the edit link, or to unlock editing.",
  "guide.faq.pin.q": "I forgot the PIN",

  "guide.faq.offline.q": "What if I lose the connection?",
  "guide.faq.offline.a":
    "Keep typing. Your changes are kept and merge when the connection returns. If you chose not to keep offline copies, they are held only in the open tab, so don't close it.",

  "guide.faq.history.a":
    "Only the owner. Deleted text in it is never sent to other people, and old versions are removed after the retention period.",
  "guide.faq.internet.q": "Does it need the internet?",
  "guide.faq.internet.a":
    "No. Everything comes from the server on your network. The server itself may check for new releases unless the administrator turns that off.",
  "guide.faq.tracking.q": "Does it track me?",
  "guide.faq.tracking.a":
    "There are no analytics, ads or trackers, and with the default settings the browser contacts only the codesh server (a sign-in provider, if the administrator set one up, is the exception).
